Hello world !


Welcome to the PythonDatabaseGui , this is a fun Gui program created using python 2.7 and wxPython and Sqlite3 as a database.
The program does the following:

1- Add a character 
2- View all the characters in the database
3- Delete a character 


There is some features you can add to it like updating the character or adding an authentication to the program it is all up to you

Cant wait to hear from you and I am welcoming each of your suggestions.

Thank you hand Have fun !
